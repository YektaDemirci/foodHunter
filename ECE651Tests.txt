Test Ideas

Examples from notes
- The system shall ensure that the data can be accessed only by authorized users (login for wishlist)
- New user should be able to add ingredients, pick a restaurant and know where to place the order within 5 minutes on their first attempt.

What are we craving
- User input needs to be interpreted correctly in absence of delimiter: i.e. sea-weed/sea weed/seaweed (similarly brown rice)
- When suggestion items are clicked, they should automatically be filled into the input of the search form.
- When user has input a valid ingredient, next steps should be evident (in UI mockup, perhaps green arrow is gray at first)
- If user chooses not to automatically allow for location, they have the ability to manually enter 

What we found
- Top x food options that have the most matching ingredients are listed.
- Top x restaurants sorted with the most relevant number of food options ranked
- Ensure that ingredients selected by the user are visible when on the 'what we found panel'
- Ensure when returning to ingredients panel, user input is still there
- Have the ability to load more restaurants and return to previously loaded (assuming implementation of Top x)

Order review
- Verify ingredients, restaurant / options are visible when on the 'review' page
- Ensure delivery time takes into account (x factors - gas? weather? traffic?)

All panels
- Ensure UI includes indicator showing user progress in the steps (Mock up uses background panel colors)
- Each panel should be clear on how to proceed
